# Misc Tools


## Emulator

Apart from using physical devices, one should use emulators as they are as of now easy to manage and equivalently powerful.

- [Intel Emulator bundled in SDK Manger](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator.html)

## **_[scrcpy](https://github.com/genymobile/scrcpy)_**

It is basically used to display and control your Android device and is the open source equivalent of [Vysor](http://www.vysor.io/). The good folks at [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/) built this tool and then open sourced it (Open Source FTW).


## [DeskDock](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.floriandraschbacher.deskdock.free)

Yes, vysor was great, but if you want to share your keyboard and mouse directly to your Android device, then this app is for you. It enables you to control your Android device as if it was part of your desktop computer. The [FREE version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.floriandraschbacher.deskdock.free) includes the use of computer mouse, while the [PRO version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.floriandraschbacher.deskdock.pro) includes features such as use of keyboard. This is useful where you can test your app without your hands ever leaving your keyboard.
